What is client-toolset?
******************

Client toolset is a Javascript library for wrapping implementaions into conceptual abstractions for cleaner code
in main JS application.


Why another library?
*******************************

Actually, clean wrapper libraries are hard to find, and they provide an easier life for the application focused
programmer which want to keep their head off implementaion term focused API's.

How to install:
***************

Well, simply add library with an ordinary script tag after all required libraries.


All the best,
